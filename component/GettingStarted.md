Custom dialogs for picking dates and simple lists

## Usage ##

Both the `DHSimplePickerDialog` and `DHDatePickerDialog` dialog classes are based on `DHDialogView` which can easily be sub-classed to create your own custom dialogs.  

Currently there are two standard ones, though more are planned in the future.

- Date Picker
- Simple list picker
